# About es-git

es-git is a modern git library built for Node.js. With its simple and intuitive interface, even complex git operations
can be easily integrated, and the built-in TypeScript types ensure fast and reliable development.

es-git builds high-performance git functionality across different operating systems by using [napi-rs](https://napi.rs/)
to compile a native module from [git2-rs](https://github.com/rust-lang/git2-rs), which binds to libgit2.

Furthermore, by offering pre-built native modules tailored to your OS and CPU architecture without relying
on node-gyp, the module can be installed effortlessly without the need to build it locally.
