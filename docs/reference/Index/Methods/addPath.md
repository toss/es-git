# addPath

Add or update an index entry from a file on disk.

This forces the file to be added to the index, not looking at gitignore
rules.

If this file currently is the result of a merge conflict, this file will
no longer be marked as conflicting. The data about the conflict will be
moved to the "resolve undo" (REUC) section.

## Signature

```ts
class Index {
  addPath(path: string): void;
}
```
