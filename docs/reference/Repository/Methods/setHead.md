# setHead

Make the repository `HEAD` point to the specified reference.

If the provided reference points to a tree or a blob, the `HEAD` is
unaltered and an error is returned.

If the provided reference points to a branch, the `HEAD` will point to
that branch, staying attached, or become attached if it isn't yet. If
the branch doesn't exist yet, no error will be returned. The `HEAD` will
then be attached to an unborn branch.

Otherwise, the `HEAD` will be detached and will directly point to the
commit.

class Repository {
  setHead(refname: string): void;
